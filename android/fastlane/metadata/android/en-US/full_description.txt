Get the driving statistics from your Azure Sphere OBD scanner and see them on a map or in simple charts. This app communicates to the tool via Wi-Fi (also hotspot, currently testing) and if connected to the Internet, it will allow the tool to securely update when needed, via the Azure Sphere security systems. An OBD mikroBUS click is recommended, but other AT-compatible OBD modules will work with minor firmware modifications.
